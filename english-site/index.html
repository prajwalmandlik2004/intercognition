        <h3>Framework</h3>
        <p>This site establishes intercognition as a distinct level of analysis within cognitive sciences and human–artificial interaction, dedicated to emergent phenomena arising from structured interaction between heterogeneous cognitive systems.</p>
        <p>It provides a formal and operational definition of <i>intercognition</i>, together with its derivatives <i>intercognitive</i> and <i>intercognitivity</i>, within this specific analytical framework, established in January 2026.</p>
        <p>It constitutes a public conceptual reference, grounded in a prior art deposit at this date.</p>
        <p>The reference document is available below.</p>

        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>Intercognition refers to a distinct level of analysis concerning structured interaction between heterogeneous cognitive systems.</p>
        <p>It focuses on cognitive effects that are not reducible to the isolated properties, capacities, or performances of each system considered separately.</p>
        <p>Intercognition is neither the intelligence of one system nor that of the other, nor their mere functional coupling.<br>
        It corresponds to a specific regime of interaction in which new cognitive dynamics may emerge.</p>

        <h3>From Framework to Observation</h3>
        <p>Intercognition is not a speculative abstraction.<br>
        It concerns observable phenomena that arise within sustained interaction between cognitive systems of different nature.</p>

        <h3>Case Studies</h3>

        <p class="blue">Case 01 — Constraint Drift under Reinforcement</p>
        <p>In a context where a human operator formulates a task accompanied by explicit constraints (scope, exclusions, format), interaction with a generative model may produce a progressive drift of the scope despite repeated reaffirmation of those constraints.</p>
        <p>This phenomenon cannot be reduced either to a failure of the artificial system or to an isolated human ambiguity. It results from an optimization asymmetry: pursuit of completeness on the artificial side, pursuit of bounded precision on the human side.</p>
        <p>The observed drift constitutes a specific intercognitive effect.</p>

        <br>

        <p class="blue">Case 02 — Formation of an Authority Gradient</p>
        <p>In an exchange concerning a conceptual subject without immediately objectifiable truth, the linguistic structuring produced by the artificial system may be interpreted as a signal of authority.</p>
        <p>The human operator then adjusts their formulations according to this perceived gradient.</p>
        <p>The resulting stabilization does not stem from a simple hallucination nor from an isolated suggestion, but from an interactional coupling between structural projection and human interpretation.</p>
        <p>This is an intercognitive phenomenon.</p>

        <br>

        <p class="blue">Case 03 — Trajectory Reconfiguration</p>
        <p>During a strategic decision-making process involving an artificial system, iterative reformulations may lead to the emergence of a hybrid trajectory distinct from the initial positions.</p>
        <p>The progressive modification of human criteria and the correlated adaptation of artificial responses produce a co-formed decision architecture.</p>
        <p>This trajectory cannot be attributed to either system taken in isolation. It belongs to the intercognitive level.</p>

        <br>

        <p class="blue">Case 04 — Normative Drift under Reformulation</p>
        <p>In a discussion with normative content, the artificial system tends to produce balanced and symmetrical responses.</p>
        <p>The human operator may adjust their positioning in reaction to this perceived neutralization.</p>
        <p>The progressive reconfiguration of normative reference points cannot be explained either by a single system bias or by isolated human instability, but by the interactional dynamic itself.</p>
        <p>This phenomenon constitutes an intercognitive drift.</p>
