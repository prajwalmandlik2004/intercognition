        <h3>Welcome</h3>
        <p>This website presents the first formal definition of the intercognitive field.</p>
        <p>It serves as a public conceptual reference, based on a prior-art deposit established in January 2026.</p>
        <p>The reference document is available below.</p>




        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>Intercognition refers to the process and analytical level specific to the continuous interaction between two
            heterogeneous cognitive systems, within which cognitive effects emerge that are not reducible to the
            properties, capacities, or performances of either system considered in isolation.</p>
        <p>Intercognition is distinct from the intelligence of one system or the other, and from their mere functional
            coupling.</p>
        <p>It defines a specific regime of interaction in which the resulting cognitive dynamics cannot be adequately
            described by individual, collective, distributed, or metacognitive frameworks alone.</p>
