# Intercognition — cross-perspective cognition

**Tagline:** Definition and resources for interdisciplinary study of "Intercognition".

## Purpose

This repository provides a public, timestamped reference for the Intercognition concept, associated documentation, metadata, and a minimal collaboration infrastructure. It complements the Soleau deposit and the official websites: https://intercognition.org and https://intercognition.fr.

## Short definition

Intercognition refers to emergent cognitive phenomena arising from interactions among agents, systems, and disciplinary contexts, including human–machine exchanges and interdisciplinary practices.

## Long definition

Intercognition gathers theoretical, methodological, and empirical approaches aimed at understanding how heterogeneous perspectives, knowledge, and cognitive processes articulate, translate, and produce new knowledge or behaviors when brought into relation. The term covers:

- human / artificial intelligence interactions;
- processes of co-construction of meaning between disciplines;
- dynamics of translation and epistemic alignment;
- methods for evaluation and intersubjective annotation.

## Origin and Formal Status

The French term *intercognition* (and its derivatives *intercognitif* and *intercognitivité*) is introduced as a neologism and formally defined for the first time in January 2026 through a Soleau prior art deposit.

In English, while the word "intercognition" has appeared sporadically in unrelated contexts, this repository establishes its first formal and operational definition within the present analytical framework, dedicated to the study of emergent phenomena arising from structured interaction between heterogeneous cognitive systems.

The reference document available on the official sites constitutes the authoritative formulation of this framework.
